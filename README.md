## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project by copying the `.env.example` file.
 
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
2. Fill in the variables in your `.env` file with the appropriate values.
3. Run the application in dev mode.
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```
# Running the Bot in a Docker Container

If you prefer to run the bot in a Docker container, you can use the official Docker image available on Docker Hub.

To use the image, you will need to have Docker installed on your machine. You can download and install Docker from the [official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

Once you have Docker installed, you can run the bot in a Docker container using the following command:
    
```bash
docker run -d -e API_KEY=<your_api_key> -e SUMMONER_V4_URL=<your_summoner_v4_url> -e REGION_URL=<your_region_url> -e DATA_DRAGON_URL=<your_data_dragon_url> -e MATCH_ANALYSIS_COUNT=<match_analysis_count> -e DISCORD_API_KEY=<your_discord_api_key> -e DISCORD_TEXT_CHANNEL=<your_discord_text_channel> bookmantasty/bookmandiscordbot:v0.0.3
``` 
Make sure to replace `<your_api_key>`, `<your_summoner_v4_url>`, `<your_region_url>`, `<your_data_dragon_url>`, `<match_analysis_count>`, and `<your_discord_api_key>` with your actual values.

You can also customize the configuration by passing additional environment variables. Here are all the available environment variables and their default values:

- `API_KEY`: `RGAPI-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`
- `SUMMONER_V4_URL`: `https://la1.api.riotgames.com/`
- `REGION_URL`: `https://americas.api.riotgames.com/`
- `DATA_DRAGON_URL`: `https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/`
- `MATCH_ANALYSIS_COUNT`: `10`
- `DISCORD_API_KEY`: `DISCORD_API_KEY_NOT_SET`

To use a custom value for any of these variables, simply pass the new value as an environment variable when running the container.

You can find the official Docker image for this bot on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/bookmantasty/bookmandiscordbot).

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it‚Äôs not an _√ºber-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _√ºber-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _√ºber-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/bookmandiscordbot-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.
